BQLZR 600P/R Incremental Rotary Encoder  
Connection:  
Red = A phase, Green = B phase, White =Vcc power +, Black = power -  
Notice: AB 2phase **output must not be directly connected with VCC**, otherwise, will burn the output triode.  

Transistor(triode) in the rotary encoder has no spec stated for current limit.  
I have seen other SOT23 components with 100mA collector max but I can not makeout any lettering on transistor.  
There is a 10Ω smd resistor in series to the collect and A & B wired phase outputs.  
That is 0.5A @ 5V. Is the transistor rated for 500mA? I played it safe and added another resistor in series. 
You choose if you want to spend another 5¢ - 10¢ on the project.
