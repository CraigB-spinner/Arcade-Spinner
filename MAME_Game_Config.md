**Major Havov** has a special Roller controller, a video from John's Arcade showed a close-up of the Urethane rubber wheel in contact with metal roller which drives the pin-wheel (24T) optical sensor. The ratio measured on a monitor (scale 1½ to John's thumb) was 3.250" / 0.635" = 5.2 x 24T = 124.8 PPR approx. <BR/>
