**On your computer, or RetroPie**  

**to setup a game** in MAME the spinner needs to be adjusted <BR/>
from 1 thru 255 where 100 is 100% or 1-to-1, no change. <BR/>
**UltiMarc** & **Groovy Game Gear** Spinners both run at 1200 PPR, <BR/>
the Chinese Rotary Encoder(600 PPR) Quad output is programmed to 1200 PPR as well.

To make a change to Game sensitivity:
- Open the game <BR/>
- Press **\<TAB\>** on keyboard <BR/>
- Select **'Analog Controls'** <BR/>
- Select **'Dial Sensitivity'** <BR/>

**Major Havov** has a special rare Roller controller, a video from John's Arcade showed a close-up of Urethane rubber wheel in contact with metal roller which drives the pin-wheel (24T) optical sensor. This is similar when determining a Trackball's, Ball to Roller diameter ratio giving a 'gear-up' drive to affixed pin-wheel. Calculating the ratio, you toss out the value for 𝜋 (circumference = 2𝜋r or 𝜋d) or any video image scale. <BR/>
The ratio measured on my monitor (scale 1½ to John's thumb) was 3.250" / 0.625" = 5.2 x 24T = 124.8 PPR approx. (±5% Error) <BR/>
